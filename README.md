* It is a kaggle contest and it is implemented by many ways like neural networks, ensemble model ( check out kaggle regression in Artificial Neural Network Repository.

* In this repository, we are going to use XGBoost to the same problem to improve its accuracy.

* Requirements:
1) Numpy
2) Pandas
3) Matplotlib
4) XgBoost
